# How does this work?
**Contributions** are a big part of *GitHub*, and most public repositories include public contribution guidelines, 
in a file such as the one you're reading.

This is a __.md__ file, [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which is a very ~~responsive~~ 
intuitive lightweight markup ~blockchain~ language. I linked a _GitHub_ guide which takes Iess than five minutes to read, or 
you could check this file's `source code` for some basic examples. Here's how:
1. Raw text
1. Fork this project and edit the file
